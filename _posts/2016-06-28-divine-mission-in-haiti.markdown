## Catholic Missions in Haiti

Deacon Patrick Moynihan is a Catholic missionary who runs the “Haitian Project,” a non-profit religious charity. Located in a Port-au-Prince suburb, Moynihan’s Louverture-Cleary school offers free high school education to qualified area youth. Moynihan is one of many religious missionaries who work to reform Haiti’s education system.
